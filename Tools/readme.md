## Tools

### 1.
Branching is the best thing about version control. Branching allows a developer to
develop new feature without worrying about messing with production code base. It allows
developers to recover to the master branch if they end up messing something up. Branch
naming allows developers to clearly mark the feature or bug they are working on.


### 2.
#### Pros:
    - You can run anything anywhere. There is no "This worked on my machine" excuse.
    - Ability to use a "microservice" infrastructure.
#### Cons:
    - Opening ports and getting docker containers to talk to each other can be a pain
    - Apple does not give Docker access to Mac OS source code so Docker for Mac is
      an abstracted VM containing the UNIX kernel.

### 3.
I usually chose to work with something that I'm fimiliar with. It allows me to quickly
get something up and running without having to worry about syntax issues or language
idiosyncrasies.

I chose to work with python. I chose python because it allow developers top
get something running very quickly and is also an object orientated language. I am also
very fimiliar with python and it allows me to focus on the problem at hand.
